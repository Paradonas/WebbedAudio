# WebbedAudio
## -App that enables user to easily download audio files from sites

The purpose of this program is to be able to download media files, specifically audio files from free audiobook websites. This is to allow for remote listening without any current internet connection as well as to enable other media features that aren't avaliable or work poorly on the sites. Some examples of problems I've encountered on sites such as these are as follows:

* Listening progress isn't saved.
* Basic media buttons are not prevelant such as:
    + On mobile: Volume modifier removed.
    + Download track option has been removed.
    + Autoplay next track  not prevelant.
    + Repeat or Shuffle also not avaliable.
* Track slider works poorly and doesn't display track time at thumb before navigation (or thumb release).
* Additional track info that is often avaliable in mp3 files such as:
    + Author.
    + Title.
    + Series or Album.
    + Number.
    + Publisher.
* And much more.

With this project I want to make it easier to listen to free audiobooks from websites such as these. I also want to have these feautures avaliable to me as I often listen myself (one of my favourite passtimes). Please comment on any features that are missing or that you think would make this app better. Also comment on sites that you want the app to work on that it currently do not.

> Note: This project contains methods to handle websites similair to [Golden Audiobooks](https://goldenaudiobooks.com/), [101 Audiobooks](https://101audiobooks.com/) and [FullLengthAudiobooks](https://fulllengthaudiobooks.com/), the project were also tested on these sites. 

### Development notes

This project was created not only beacause of creating the app itself and the use I will have for it, but also for educational purposes. This means you should expect many quirks, flaws and bugs a pleanty. This also means development is a slow and daunting process and that the app may not be completed. Please provide improvements if possible, you can do so in GitHubs message feature for this repository.

You can find the parts or planned parts / future features in my [other AIP project](https://github.com/Paradonas/Webbed-Audio-AIP/). This is also where you should submit issues, bugs and crashes on the **issues** tab. Mention features you'd like to be added or pages you'd like the app to support in the **discussion**.

### Creation


Project was created with Visual Studio 2019 and 2022 .dotnet C# WPF. I also plan to make a mobile app out of this if I ever finish this desktop design. This will be made with Xamarin since it would be easily transferable.
